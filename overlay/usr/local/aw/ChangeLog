2019-01-08 Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 5.6.2 released.

       * Re-introduced FreeBSD/amd64 port for FreeBSD V11.
         Deprecated: SCSI device support.

       * Re-introduced Solaris/Intel port for Solaris 10+.
         Deprecated: SCSI device support.

       * FR#930: Adding metadata in P5 archive.

         Added more clever logic: per-job metadata can be
         overriden by non-empty per-file metadata.
         One can mix both but one cannot combine/merge values.

       * FR#929: Backup of nested filesystems.

         In order to support backup of large/deep hierarchical
         filesystems (like for example ZFS) one can now enable
         crossing filesystem boundary while walking the
         filesystem tree and looking for changed files.
         To do that, one needs to edit config/lexxsrv.<PORT>
         file (where <PORT> is the value assigned during the
         installation; default = 8000), and put those two lines
         somewhere at the end of the file:

            ns_sect ns/server/$server/module/Backup/CLIENT
            ns_param crossFilesystemBoundary true

         where CLIENT is the name of the P5 client.
         Default value for crossFilesystemBoundary is "false",
         which means that file walk will not cross filesystem
         boundary.

         After changing the file, P5 needs to be restarted for
         changes to become active.

       * FR#895: volumes with backing cloud-stores can now be
         manually synced-up with the cloud storage, regardles
         of their internal state. This aids in cleaning-up the
         volume cache for volume data stored in cloud only.

       * FR#875: sending e-mail is now more persistent in case
         of mail-server connection problems.

       * FR#874: added CLI command "Volume jobs" that lists job
         names of all the jobs that were writing to the volume.

       * FR#861: added tunable size for disk IO operations.

         To change disk IO size, edit the config/lexxsrv.<PORT>
         file (where <PORT> is the value assigned during the
         installation; default = 8000) and put those two lines
         somewhere at the end of the file:

            ns_sect ns/server/$server/module/jobex/CLIENT
            ns_param bioSize SIZE

         where CLIENT is the name of the P5 client
         and SIZE is a value in bytes, aligned to 512.

         After changing the file, P5 needs to be restarted for
         changes to become active.

       * Added multithreading support for Sync cycle creation
         on filesystems w/o snapshot option.

         To enable MT, one needs to edit config/lexxsrv.<PORT>
         file (where <PORT> is the value assigned during the
         installation; default = 8000), and put those two lines
         somewhere at the end of the file:

            ns_sect ns/server/$server/module/Sync
            ns_param cycleThreadCount 1

         Default value for cycleThreadCount is 1 (one).
         Increasing number of threads for cycle generation might
         speed up this (lenghtly) operation if target filesystem
         is located on SSD device or on a very fast RAID system.

         After changing the file, P5 needs to be restarted for
         changes to become active.

       * Fixed B2Go connection losses after 3 minutes waiting
         for the next changed file (Bug#928).

       * Fixed entering old-style licenses (Bug#925).

       * Fixed timeouts in Sync during long snapshot creation
         (Bug#923).

       * Fixed mail delivery when two or more e-mails were
         sent within one second interval (Bug#921).

       * Fixed cleanup of backup indexes containing large
         number of recycled volumes (Bug#918).

       * Fixed handling of Mac resource forks for HFS+ -> HFS+
         copies (Bug#915).

       * Added "ignore cleaning flag" for special applications.
         To ignore the cleaning flag for selected drives, edit
         the config/lexxsrv.<PORT> file (where <PORT> is the
         value assigned during the installation; default = 8000)
         and put those two lines somewhere at the end of the file:

            ns_sect ns/server/$server/module/medmgr
            ns_param dontClean "DEV1 DEV2 ... DEVn"

         where DEV1, DEV2, etc. are names of the tape devices
         as shown in the P5 GUI.

         After changing the file, P5 needs to be restarted for
         changes to become active.

       * Fixed write-speed issues for large-file archives (Bug#913).

       * Fixed auto-recognition of EtherShare volumes (Bug#907).

       * Fixed crashes on archives to cloud when jobs terminate
         unexpectedly or get cancelled manually (Bug#904).

       * Fixed crashes on Mac (and possibly other platforms) when
         rebuilding indexes after the backup.

       * Reduce number of warnings in GUI about Sync plans running
         in transfer mode (Bug#900).

       * Fixed restore entry for Sync plans when there is only
         one Sync license configured (Bug#989).

       * Fixed mode of resource sub-directories created during the
         restore within EtherShare volumes to 0777 (Bug#892).

       * Fixed spurious virtual tape driver errors claiming the
         volume being written has no label attached (Bug#891).

       * Fixed loading the LTFS driver for IBM LTO drives (Bug#890).

       * Fixed Sync file-event handling when source of events is
         not the localhost computer (Bug#888).

       * Fixed "Back Arrow" side-effects in GUI after log-in (Bug#885).

       * Added missing Client2Client manual Sync option (Bug#884).

       * Removed Cancel button from log-out pane (Bug#882).

       * Fixed Backup job lock-out after Volume recycle (Bug#877).

       * Added Application-Key support for BackBlaze cloud (Bug#858).

       * Fixed resource fork handling during restore to non-HFS
         filesystems resulting in IO-error messages (Bug#901).

       * Fixed generic install script on Unix to ignore Synology
         install options (Bug#842).

       * Removed scanning files before arhive and backup.
         This feature was simply consuming resources and
         did not provide any realy useful information.

       * Fixed label of cloud volumes in case of upload errors
         (Bug#820).

       * Improved bandwidth throttle code to handle 10Gbps
         ethernet links (Bug#143).

        * Added log about used archive index offset to
          aid support.

        * Fixed snapshot purge for backup that caused far
          too many snapshots to be held online.

        * Fixed treatment of user preference records with
          embedded blanks.

2018-05-15 Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

          being broken by Windows security update.

2018-04-05 Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 5.5.4 released.

        * Improved file upload/download to/from clients.
          Uses timed non-blocking transfer with regular
          http post/get sequence. Previous behaviour
          resulted in partial transfers on heavily loaded
          MT-machines. Transfer is still limited to 2GB.

        * Suppresed creation of void database files outside
          the config directory (Bug #778, #775).

        * Added object store volume cleanup job at the end
          of executing a backup/archive job.

        * Fixed handling of bonded file-systems for backup.

        * Fixed race condition for CLI jobs that reported
          completed state before actually started by the
          scheduler thread (Bug #776).

	* Added a checksum to P5 exe on Windows to accomodate
	  the Tandberg RDX Access Control client and the
	  ransom blocker.

        * Fixed file-events handling on Mac to cope with
          last-reported-event of zero which may result in
          irregular overflow errors.

        * Changed ID's of the objects stored on object stores
          to look like paths so implementations may optimize.

2017-12-19 Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 5.5.3 released.

        * Fixed QNAP creation of folders from the GUI file selector.

        * Fixed case when two or more archive jobs work on the partially
          overlapping directory structures that have never been archived
          before (Bug #684/#753).

        * Fixed ctime disable setup in config file (Bug #731).

        * Fixed B2Go restore on Windows clients (Bug #741/#742).

        * Fixed media changer internal error when attempting to mount
          subsequent volume(s) (Bug #751).

        * Fixed volume regeneration in disk media changer (Bug #756).

        * Fixed CLI to properly check username for socket conns (Bug #757).

        * Fixed CLI inventory commands that were not reporting entry handles
          at all after update to V5.5 (Bug #759/#764).

        * Fixed file-events sync that was causing too much directories to
          be reported as changed.

        * Fixed cases where we hit locked database on various index ops.

        * Added basic support for new Apple APFS filesystem (FR #744).

2017-11-06 Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 5.5.2 released.

        * Added LTO8 to the list of supported tape drives.

        * Added separate config file options for testing inode change time
          for backup and archive jobs and combined. Those are controlled
          over three config options:

             a.
	     ns_section ns/server/$server/module/ArchiveLookupSelection
             ns_param testInodeChangeTime true|false

             b.
	     ns_section ns/server/$server/module/BackupLookupSelection
             ns_param testInodeChangeTime true|false

             c.
	     ns_section ns/server/$server/module/LookupSelection
             ns_param testInodeChangeTime true|false

          The a. configures the option for archive plans only.
	  The b. configures the option for backup plans only.
	  The c. configures the option for any plan.

          Default is "true" i.e. check inode change time when doing
          incremental save operation. Can be set to "false" to avoid
          testing inode change time. A file inode changes every time
          there is a change of the ACL, ownership and/or metadata
          of the file.

        * Fixed client2client sync that occasionally left the synced
          files on the server machine.

        * Fixed stop signal for archive/backup jobs to correctly propagate
          to object store up/downloaders.

        * Fixed B2Go encryption backup for (at least) Mac clients.

	* Fixed object store up/downloaders on Synology devices that were
          occasionally stalled on an unknown file descriptor.

	* Fixed access to Manual Archiving for non-privileged users who
          are granted archiving privilege.

	* Fixed syntax error during automatic recycling causing a failed message
	  in the log and failing to mail the result of recycling.

2017-10-16 Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 5.5.1 released.

        * Fixed treatment of user-defined meta keys for arhive indexes
          which contain interpunction characters (Bug#701).

        * Fixed volume-chunk deletion during volume re-label (Bug#702).

        * Added option to configure ctime checking separately for
          archive and backup incremental operations (FR#706).

        * Fixed bad connection test for Generic S3 cloud services.
          Also, reduced timeout on connection problems from five
          to one minute, as not to block GUI for too long (Bug#708).

        * Fixed some minor compatibility issues in generic S3 object
          store connector.

        * Improved remote agent login handling for delegated syncs.

        * Fixed occasions where regular blockpool teardown might be
          interpreted as error, effectively making valid jobs to fail.

        * Fixed occasional index corruption happening after some index
          maintenance tasks.

        * Added cloud wizzard in the GUI.

        * Fixed occasional communication issues in Sync jobs when
          transferring very small checkum difference file(s).

        * Honour job stop signals within volume chunk uploads.

        * Fixed B2Go encryption handling for backup.

        * Fixed job monitor issues where a cascade of running jobs
          may miss the top-level job slot for progress/cancel.

2017-09-07 Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 5.5.0 released.

2017-07-12 Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 5.4.4 released.

        * Fixed BTRFS snapshot creation when target directory is
          on a subvolume (FR#652).

        * Fixed CLI Job status command that may return wrong results
          due to timing issues (Bug#658).

          Multiple elements are relocated with their leading
          path retained in the relocation directory.

        * Included support for Helios UB64.

2013-11-20 Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 5.0.6 released.

        * Fixed filesystem device ID handling to honour cases where
          device ID may be the same 16-bit value for two different
          filesystem, thus invalidating incremental saves.

2013-11-12 Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 5.0.5 released.

        * Improved index performance, both archive and backup.
          During startup or latest before first archive and/or
          backup operation, the index conversion is attempted.
          The conversion routine locks the index for writing
          so all backup/archive jobs started while the conversion
          is still running, will stall.

        * B2Go backup stops if the available space on the
          filesystem where repository is pointing to drops
          below 10%.

        * B2Go snapshot purge attempts to randomize order
          of the workstations being purged.

          snapshot emulation in B2Go are purged or deleted.

        * Restore to relocated location now makes sure the
          place where to restore is created if not found.

        * Fixed occasional crash when accessing library.

        * Fixed browsing the index when data retention times
          are set beyond 2038.

          have saved temporary index chunks in addition
          to the main chunk, which caused problem during
          index restore.

          report timeout conditions as per-file POSIX
          errors instead of terminating the operation.

          directory structures are deleted and re-created under
          the same name(s).

        * Resolved startup problems on Windows when many network
          interfaces are available.

        * Prevented possible deadlocks during recycling when
          multiple jobs are running in parallel on the same pool.

        * Fixed "prefligt" checking of the tape positions

          resources is prolonged to reduce the interference with other
          jobs and the process load.

          fileserver volumes.

        * Fixed handling of some older ADIC jukeboxes.

        * Changed layout of AppleDouble files as stored on non-HFS
          filesystems to be more compatbile with Apple's copyfile(3).
          Also, use standard ACL/xattr API calls where possible and

        * Fixed memory errors in Windows distribution, for example
          during nightly restart.

        * Fixed handling of long username/password combinations that

        * Fixed crashing in Solaris/Intel port while sending email.

        * Fixed jukebox handling in auto-mount-inventory when the
          jukebox is reported busy or some other SCSI error happens.

        * Jukebox heartbeat thread polling frequency can now be
          adjusted by adding the following ns_section/ns_param
          commands to the server configuration file:

              ns_section ns/libarchdev
              ns_param jbhbeat 10

          Above sets the polling frequency to 10 seconds.
          Default is 5 seconds. To disable the jukebox monitoring
          completely, set the jbhbeat parameter to 0 seconds.

        Version 3.0.4 released. Changes since last release

        * Disables potential man-in-the-middle attacks on Web-GUI
          by somebody stealing and reusing encrypted usernames
          and passwords.

        * Fixed backup weekly schedule calculation when first run
          of the plan is set in the future and overlaps with the
          selected schedule for that day.

        * Fixed backup scheduler to cope with time-shift of jobs
          that eventually start later then configured, due to
          excessive system load.

        * Job monitor text for backup jobs now contains the
          level information ( Re-added due to popular demand ).

        * Save jobs hitting the media error during writing will
          mark the current media as suspect and continue on the
          next available appendable volume in the pool.

        * Media manager now attempts to locate next suitable
          volume for writing even if the jukebox inventory is
          found invalid and calculated writable volume from
          the pool cannot be mounted.

        * Backup task now does not reserve volumes used by the last
          full backup plus all subsequent increments. Recycling of
          such volumes is now only subject to retention time as
          specified per backup plan.

        * Added persistent jukebox monitor thread that registers
          all unusual jukebox events, like setting the unit offline
          or opening jukebox doors. Such events are used to trigger
          automatic jukebox barcode inventory.

        * Added etc/sendmail.applescript to send email on Mac OS X
          workstations w/o configured Postfix mail server.

        * Improved cancellation of long-running jobs on remote clients.

        * Automatically invalidate and rebuild backup lookup indexes
          when volumes get recycled or deleted.

        * Fixed MT-unsafe handling of mounted filesystems lookup on
          Linux servers.

        * Corrected some Japaneese translations.

        * Added Pool column in the Volume listing.

        * Added shortcut to standalone tape devices in the toolbar.

        * Removed aftermath changing of virtual jukebox geometry.
          In order to change virtual jukebox geometry, the device
          needs to be deleted and re-created again.

        * Removed Pool selection from extended search options for
          backup and archive indexes.

2008-04-07 Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 3.0.3 released. Changes since last release

        * Fixed sending test mail from within user preference.

        * Added new SUA users in the supported licenses database.

        * Fixed protection of resource groups in the configuration
          database that prevented non-root users to submit restore
          and/or archive jobs.

        * Added QuickStart help item which attempts to simplify
          first-time experience when evaluating the product.

        * Automatically recycled volumes are not set to Suspect.

        * Volumes blocked by the current cycle are released after
          a new full backup.

        * Fixed daylight time saving for scheduled backup jobs.

        * Fixed licensing of virtual disk devices within a jukebox
          so they dont steal license units from real media drives.

        * Filter volumes marked for deletion from the volume list.

        * Fixed taking inventory after recycling volumes.

2008-03-20 Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 3.0.2 released. Changes since last release

        * Fixed memory leak and potential memory trash in Mac OS X
          acl_to_text() library call as it is broken since 10.4 up
          to the 10.5 OS X version.

        * Fixed race condition in backup indexer when two or more
          job executors may deadlock when attempting to release
          the indexer thread.

        * Disabled error-counters inquiry for HP Ultrium-4 devices
          as some of them have broken firmware.

        * Fixed broken Intel/Solaris distribution which failed to
          load on some Solaris10 buidls.

        * Mail sender/server setting done in the configuration file
          are now automatically joined in the configuration of the
          localhost machine, so they are visible in the GUI.

        * Added support for relocatable Desktop databases for Helios
          EtherShare fileserver.

2008-03-03 Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 3.0.1 released. [The Two-Years-After Release]

2008-02-20 Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 2.3.16 released. Changes since last release

        * Fixed Unix distributions as some were compiled wrongly.

2008-02-18 Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 2.3.15 released. Changes since last release

        * Fixed start-at-boot on Mac OS X broken by the previous
          patch release while moving startup machinery to launchd.

        * Fixed memory leak when saving or restoring files with
          total path length larger than 200 bytes.

        * Improved restore selection to early skip files located on
          recycled volumes.

        * Fixed media reservation problem that caused parallel saves
          to fail under some circumstances.

        * Back-ported disk driver from the V3 including new faster
          compression algorithm and automatic volume-repair option.

2008-01-17 Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 2.3.14 released. Changes since last release

        * Fixed hangs in Sync control channel, happening with some
          high-speed and high-latency WAN links.

        * Reduced timeout while establishing reverse client connection
          from 86400 to 120 secs in order to quickly recover from
          temporary client problems.

        * Switched to use launchd on Mac OS X 10.5.

        * Fixed preview generation using QuickTime on Max OS X 10.5

        * Fixed inventory in jukebox without a barcode reader when
          volumes have not been previously labeled

        * Prevents TCP socket leaking on reverse client connections
          during sync.

2007-11-22 Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 2.3.13 released. Changes since last release

        * Fixed backup task scheduling for plans saving more
          than one client, where one client backup runs longer
          than one day, whereas other client backup is done
          fairly quickly. In such cases the quicker backup may
          be re-scheduled using wrong startup time.

        * Fixed remote agent timeouts when generating large
          Sync cycles.

        * Synthetic backups now use unnamed pipes instead of TCP
          socket pairs to join restore and backup jobs. This speeds
          up the process and consumes less system resources.

        * Added Mac OS X (Intel) support for Xinet desktops.

        * Fixed download of files outside fileserver volumes on Mac OSX.

        * Extended "Job xmlticket" CLI command to allow one optional
          argument specifying the path of the file where XML job ticket
          data should be stored.

        * Prevent server restarts if there are very long running script
          executions underway.

        * Fixed problems related to scanning file systems with exotic
          characters on Windows.

        * Fixed problems related to index corruption when running
          an incremental backup on localhost on Windows.

        * Do not act on hard read/write errors as reported from tape
          drives. Instead just log the event in the system log.

        * Fixed SCSI device recognition on SuSE 10.3 Linux as the format
          of the /proc/scsi/scsi report changed.

        * Avoid using "ConsoleMessage" alias on Mac OSX 10.5 (Lepopard)
          in startup scripts, as this isn't defined any more.

2007-09-03 Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 2.3.12 released. Changes since last release

        * Added additional checking for session-ID in HTTP sessions
          between the clients and server, suppresing any potential
          session-ID reuse.

        * Added retry on control channel for communication errors
          during synchronize.

        * Fixed recognizing users belonging to admin group on Mac
          by additionaly iterating over all known groups, instead
          of just fetching the group in question by getgrnam()
          library call. It seems to deliver incomplete list of
          group members in some rare cases.

        * Fixed locating data in index on Windows 64bit installations.

        * Fixed synchronizing and resynchronizing paths with special
          characters on Windows.

        * Fixed closing volumes from different clients of the same job
          when "Use new volumes" is chosen.

        * Fixed proxy command server when running commands for usernames
          longer than (or equal to) 6 characters. This resulted in some
          files not being deleted although archive jobs were configured
          for file deletion.

        * Fixed handling of double-fork Xsan Mac files when the corresponding
          resource-fork could not be opened for reading or otherwise
          recognized. This resulted in files not being saved nor reported
          during incremental backups.

        * For backup jobs running on 2 or more devices, the total job
          status is set to "exception" when at least one of the job
          executors ran in error. Only if all job executors finished
          without errors, the job status is set to "completed".

        * Added "cli::index::backup::synchronize" CLI command to sync
          the backup index of the remote client with the actual state
          of the filesystem in cases where files deleted from the
          filesystem were not correctly marked in the index.

        * Download of support data now includes all compressed copies
          of system.log file on Mac OS X.

        * Fixed volume import of volumes created using synthetic backup.

2007-07-09  Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 2.3.11 released. Changes since last release

        * Fixed display of dataset sizes larger of 4TB during backup,
          synchronize and/or restore operations.

        * Fixed duplication of archive, backup and sync plans not to
          duplicate the handle of scheduled job and thus prohibiting
          schedule and startup of the newly duplicated plan.

        * Fixed compatibility with Internet Explorer V7 on Windows.

        * Simplified handling of desktop database update for Helios
          servers. In some cases during the sync when files are changed
          and copied to the target directory, we unnecessarily adjusted
          the ID of the parent directory which sometimes lead to dup IDs.

        * Filter out system and library cache and virtual memory files on
          Darwin so they do not get synced, archived or backed up.

        * Fixed preview generation on remote clients when path to preview
          file contained "+" character.

        * Virtual jukebox wizzard adds two media devices per unit instead
          of just one, thus allowing synthetic backups to be run on one
          jukebox unit.

        * File download always generates Mac OS X compatible zip files.

2007-05-25  Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 2.3.10 released. Changes since last release

        * Fixed open-file leak when archiving Xinet volumes
          containing bogus (zero-length) resource files.

        * Enforce cloned volumes are always written in pairs even
          when the pool has been re-configured to disable cloning.

        * Added automatic repair of inproperly closed disk-volumes.

        * Changed handling of connections to Helios desksrv. Instead
          of testing the connection with a dummy GetDeskCharset() call
          which proved to be problematic and was causing the desksrv
          to freak out sometimes, we now deliberately run into error
          when running against a stale connection. On certain set of
          errors we re-try the connection to desksrv and re-try the
          failed operation once more.

        * Fixed reserving the oldest written volume for writing
          first, in case drives are explicitely assigned to the pool.

        * Added new DLT device types to choose from when installing a
          changer.

        * Fixed job stophours processing when the very first backup
          of a plan was cancelled.

        * Fixed job auto-cancellation timing when no job monitor
          was running during job execution.

        * Added CLI tests for measuring network speeds.

2007-04-11  Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 2.3.9 released. Changes since last release

        * Fixed ACL handling for directories during sync and restore.

        * Changed handling of connections to Helios desksrv. Instead
          of tearing down the connection each idle seconds, we cache
          the connection indefinitely. On re-use, the connection is
          tested and if stale, newly established.

        * Corrected job re-scheduling in between switch to and from
          daylight saving time.

        * Corrected suppressing recycling of volumes when a backup job
          backs up more than one host.

        * Corrected Windows deadlock during thread synchronization for
          multiple jobs.

        * Fixed jukebox handling for some Spectralogic units that
          failed to report a correct element-move-matrix.

        * Fixed starting the software under non-privleged user.

        * Supressed errors about new/existing symbolic link existence
          on the target of a sync plan when running on Mac OSX

2007-03-15  Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 2.3.8 released. Changes since last release

        * Added XML-formatted job ticket delivery for CLI.

        * Resolved conflict with different file-type during the
          sync by making a new version of the target file.

        * Sync with delete will overwrite any exiting target files
          whose modification dates differ from the source.

        * Resolved deadlock on archive databases when one user was
          in the middle of search query preparation while some other
          was about to mount the database.

        * Improved reservation of volumes during synthetic backup.

2007-02-12  Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 2.3.7 released. Changes since last release

        * Fixed broken client-to-server synchronize direction
          introduced with 2.3.6 release.

        * Avoid saving empty index chunk to media device if the
          save job is prematurely cancelled or otherwise broken.

2007-02-06  Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 2.3.6 released. Changes since last release

        * Added selectable type of full backup for the monthly
          schedule. It now allows selection of the synthetic
          type as well.

        * Fixed download of support data from Windows servers.

        * Fixed link to server logs for the access from the GUI
          on Windows platform.

        * Added configurable timeout for remote-tree mounter.

        * Persist loading application resources from zip archives
          if failed to serve them from the pre-built cache.

        * Helios driver allows reuse of file/folder ID during the
          sync or restore if the target volume is set to read-only.

        * In CLI, allow setting of volume label/location/state/mode
          parameters, in addition to getting the value.

        * Added condition log that tracks all state changes for the
          lifetime of a volume introduced by the application code.

        * Added GUI warning when about to delete a volume.

        * Added automatic (implicit) clone-volume re-synchronization.

2006-12-21  Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 2.3.5 released. Changes since last release

        * Added utility to test and rectify potential wrong
          setup of jukeboxes containing 2+ drives. Currently
          only comand-line (CLI) access is opened.

        * Fixed indexer bug that sometimes caused overlay of
          directories and shadowing (make invisible) of regular
          file entries after incremental backups were performed.

        * Synthetic backup does not conclude written volumes
          if the same pool is used for full, increment and
          synthetic. We now split volumes needed for reading
          from those required for writing at pool mount time.

2006-12-12  Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 2.3.4 released. Changes since last release

        * Added environment variables passed to pre/post script.

        * Corrected recycling of imported volumes, which could
          not be relabled without deleting them from the volume
          list first.

        * Removed setting of clone volume callbacks when starting
          a job, which caused the chunk block to be empty and
          consequently making the cloned volumes not importable.

        * Changed the type of strictStreams property from boolean
          to integer. No consequence and not visible to the user.
          Needed so as to limit the number of clients per stream.

        * Added limiting the number of clients per stream. This is
          still not opened thru the GUI.

        * Fixed handling of IO-Registry path on Macintosh devices
          as saved in the configuration database if the path
          contained blanks.

        * Changed SCSI message handling on Mac OSX Intel platform
          Under some circumstances we could trigger a bug in the
          SCSI Task kernel driver and cause the machine to panic.

        * Avoid writing index on tape devices which were being
          SCSI-bus resetted in the middle of write operation.

        * Fixed loading of some AIT drives by waiting for extra
          long time for media to be fully loaded.

        * Improved volume resevation for synthetic backup, removed
          conflicts between volumes to read and to write.

        * Fixed broken submit/start of backup plan over the CLI.

        * Forbid creating resources with special reserved names.

        * Forbid creating reserved user preference records at login

        * Added Adobe Photoshop files to list of supported image formats
          for Quicktime image conversions.

        * Fixed autoinventory when jukebox is being used by some other job.

        * Improved job monitor messages when volumes or their clones are
          requested.

        * Fixed creation of the first file in a directory on windows when
          it's parent directory path is missing and needs to be created.

        * Fixed restoring from a mixed set of volumes and their clones.

        * Improved autoinventory to check only the devices assigned to
          the given pool.

        * Added additional cleanup and parking the medium in case the follower
          failed to load.

        * Added setting the medium to suspect in case we expected to find a
          label, but found the medium to be empty instead.

        * Changed to always use the available primary media, before using
          the clones.

        * Corrected reporting of volumes used for restore when the job monitor
          is not opened.

2006-11-06  Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 2.3.3 released. Changes since last release

        * Fixed jukebox and drive installation wizard on Darwin.

        * Corrected reporting of used volumes in job log.

        * Fixed deadlock when two or more jobs are terminating
          at the same (or roughly the same time).

        * Include volume and its clone in the list of volumes
          when per-volume browsing of the archive database.

        * Fixed populating of restore basket from backup index.

        * Fixed cloned volume reservation when volumes are in
          seperate jukeboxes.

2006-10-25  Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 2.3.2 released. Changes since last release

        * Removed spurious mail about device not available
          when changing media during a save job on Sun.

        * Removed breaking a job when the hard read/write
          flag was raised but otherwise no error occured.

        * Fixed GUI browsing of the backup index which failed
          to properly address elements in the index, resulting
          in empty root-level directory contents.

        * Fixed automatic recognition of special directories
          (fileserver volumes) when the above (parent) directory
          is used as the source (and/or target) in a sync plan.

2006-10-10  Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 2.3.1 released. Changes since last release

        * Changed parsing of script and arguments as entered
          in pre/postscript fields in sync, archive and backup
          plans. The new parsing scheme requires tokens to be
          divided by spaces and if the tokens themselves contain
          spaces, they have to be enclosed in curly braces.

        * Made fixed archive directories sticky so they don't
          get deleted after the archive, if the file deletion
          was configured.

        * Fixed re-schedule of Sync plan when just one runtime
          has been entered and removed from the scheduler.

        * Fixed delete pass for Sync when cycles are configured.
          Also, the delete pass now purges the target directory
          from versions.

        * On Windows, do not abort file walk if we cannot open
          some directory. Instead, log the event in the server
          log and continue.

        * Fixed deadlock occuring when multiple threads start to
          log and one of the threads is in the middle of updating
          the configuration database.

        * Changed semantics of hard read/write tape errors. In case
          one of those is encountered, the volume is set to suspect
          state, email to administrator is generated but the operation
          underway is not aborted. The reason for this is that some
          broken tape-firmware erroneusly report hard errors after some
          absolutely legal operations.

2006-09-26  Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 2.3.0 released. Changes since last release

        * Added support for driving SCSI devices like tape drives
          and jukeboxes on the Windows platform.

        * Added QuickTime still-image, film and audio previews for
          the archive module. This is currently only supported
          on the Macintosh platform.

        * Added support for Netatalk, an open-source file and print
          server for Macintosh computers running on Unix servers.
          This is currently only supported on Linux platform.

        * Replaced socket command daemon (scd) with the new
          proxy slave(s) processes operating over pipes. This
          applies to Unix-like operating systems only.

        * Added new extended job log containing all relevant log
          messages from the server log file pertaining to that
          specific job only. The generation of the extended log
          is controlled with "jobProtocol" global configuration
          option of the job scheduler module. The default value
          is "true" which turns-on the extended log generation.
          To change the value, for example to disable the extended
          job logging, add following two lines to the configuration
          file conf/lexxsrv.<port>:

              ns_section ns/server/$server/module/jobsched
              ns_param jobProtocol false

        * Added "maxConcurrentJobs" global configuration option for
          the job scheduler. The default is set to 16. To change
          the value, for example to 32 concurrent jobs. add following
          two lines to the configuration file conf/lexxsrv.<port>:

              ns_section ns/server/$server/module/jobsched
              ns_param maxConcurrentJobs 32

        * Added "testInodeChangeTime" global configuration option
          for the indexer so we can ignore or honour file ctime
          modifications when selecting files for processing.
          The default value for the option is "true" which includes
          inode change-time checking. To ignore ctime checking, add
          following lines to the configuration file conf/lexxsrv.<port>:

              ns_section ns/server/$server/module/bixindex
              ns_param testInodeChangeTime false

        * Added per-plan email addresses. If configured, job reports
          are sent to the given email addres(es) instead to the job
          owner (i.e. the user who started the job).

        * Manual start of backup plan does not automatically trigger
          execution of follower plans. Only the selected plan is
          executed with the selected level.

        * Added per-user preference to stay logged-in in the Web-GUI
          even when the browser has been terminated without explicitly
          logging out.

        * Changed click behaviour in browser to allow double-clicks
          and right-button-select on list elements.

        * Fixed incorect handling of bucket pool caused by the
          new signalization capabilities between the peers
          during the data trasnfer. This could eventually drain
          the entire bucket pool and bring the data-transfer to halt.

        * Fixed compression handling for Sony AIT4 tape devices
          with the revision 1.0.3 or earlier. The tape device
          just went astray when we attempted to force-set the
          compression flag. Customers are encouraged to update
          to the latest firmware release (1.0.4 as of 29.08.06)

        * Changed new media handling during label as some broken
          tape-device firmwares caused tape-device to hang when
          issued SCSI "Locate" command when loaded a virgin media.

2006-07-10  Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 2.2.4 released. Changes since last release

        * Adjusted AppleDouble parser to cope with zero-length
          entries as created in meta-files on Apple's Xsan.

        * Fixed bug in parsing synthetic plan value which was
          introduced by fixes in 2.2.3 release and rendered
          synthetic plan usage impossible.

        * Fixed protection checking on non-root restores where we
          wrongly checked the parent's parent directory instead of
          just parent directory of the file being restored.

        * Fixed display of values for newly configured archive plan
          where default values have been reported, instead of the
          newly entered ones.

        * Increased default timeout value for caches from 3 to 60 secs.

        * Fixed GUI bug which prevented volume import from a standalone
          device.

        * All resource deletions from GUI are now logged into log file.

        * Automatically create .HSancillary files on Xinet volumes
          because Xinet's own library does not do that which results
          in potential loss of Apple's FinderInfo structure.

        * Allow for passing additional arguments to pre/post scripts.

        * Fixed case where syncplan was using the delete flag wrongly.

        * Improved backup index browsing to properly select the right
          index chunk when more than one plan is saving the same tree.

        * Added option of overriding built-in email delivery by means
          of a user-supplied script. For more information please refer
          to: http://www.archiware.com/wiki/wiki/96

2006-06-20  Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 2.2.3 released. Changes since last release

        * Fixed root of the archive job when more than one
          entry is selected for archival.

        * Fixed protection issue when non-root users were
          restoring files directly on top of the root filesystem.

        * Fixed synchronize of files larger than 4GB.

        * Re-arranged layout of AppleDouble files generated
          on non-HFS filesystems in order to overcome finder
          crashes introduced by over-optimistic Apple's
          optimizations which broke the AppleDouble standard.
          Also, skips generating the AppleDouble meta-file if
          the file contains no metadata nor resource-fork.

        * Fixed rare cache-flush errors on configuration database.

        * Automatically stop scheduled jobs for all backup tasks
          belonging to a certain backup pan when the backup plan
          gets deleted.

2006-06-06  Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 2.2.2 released. Changes since last release

        * Fixed drive reservation when large number of jobs are
          using same pool resources.

        * Fixed cross-platform Sync (Helios/Solaris -> MacOSX/HFS+)
          where synced files got wrong modification date.

        * Temporarily removed ACL/metadata handling for cross-filesystem
          (HFS<->Xsan, HFS<->UFS) operations because files containing
          those parts caused Finder to crash and restart. The bug in
          Finder has been reported to Apple for further examination.

2006-05-22  Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 2.2.1 released. Changes since last release

        * Fixed incremental backup for windows clients.

        * Fixed broken layout of apple-double files on non-hfs
          filesystems which contained metadata values.

        * Speedup of sync jobs between Mac OSX computers which
          operated on large number of directories.

        * Fixed searches in backup indexes which had to traverse
          more than one index cycle.

        * Fixed occasional "peer closed connection" errors from clients.

        * Changed handling of timestamps of Xinet resource forks.
          They are now set to the modification time of the data
          fork explicitly.

        * Fixed broken automatic jukebox inventory.

2006-05-01  Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 2.2.0 released. Changes since last release

        * Added support for MacOSX Intel platform.

        * Added more options to user preferences to control mail delivery.

        * Job monitor shows up to 10 last jobs in list of jobs of today.

        * Fixed update of archive database(s) after volume migration.

        * Socket driver now listens at IP address 0.0.0.0 which includes
          all active interfaces and bypasses reverse DNS IP-to-hostname
          queries, which resulted in server starting problems in some
          wrongly configured IP environments.

        * Fixed parsing of file paths in sync plans which contained blanks.

        * Added note about follower volume during volume migration.

        * Fixed CLI jukebox inventory command to be compatible to 1.5 version.

        * Backup index view does not prune deleted directories. Only deleted
          files are pruned from the index view when snapshot is selected.

        * Backup index does not limit the view to the last incremental run,
          rather it shows all files and folders unfiltered. One must use
          index browse options to setup specific visit-time to get the
          snapshot view.

        * Fixed handling of Windows reserved path characters when working
          against directories under WSM control.

2006-04-13  Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 2.1.1 released. Changes since last release

        * Added workaround for bug in VS2005 causing testing of
          files on Windows having bogus modification times to
          crash the server.

        * Fixed parsing PCShare streams.

        * Fixed misleading mail subjects for backup jobs stating
          incorrect backup levels although correct levels were
          used for the job.

        * User-selected backup level always overrides any level(s)
          assigned by the scheduler.

        * Fixed restore of files from extremely deep directory
          structures.

        * Speed-up sync checking of extremely large directories
          having 1000's of files.

2006-04-03  Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 2.1.0 released. Changes since last release

        * Added support for Solaris x86 platform.

        * Added configurable timeouts for remote command sessions.

        * Added new tape-media types.

        * Added flag to use new media for volume migration.

        * Extended command-timeout to remote clients if media
          mounting takes extra long time due to lack of system
          resources.

        * We do not attempt to open resource forks for non-regular
          files on HFS filesystems any more.

        * Fixed cancellation of sync jobs from server to client.

        * Fixed labeling of media in standalone drives.

        * Fixed transfer byte-count calculations which was causing
          syncs of large directories (large number of files) to fail.

        * Fixed alternate (user-given) index root for archive jobs.

        * Fixed integer overflow in summary line when reporting
          total size of data saved accross 2 or more drives.

        * Fixed rare server cores happening when clicking on a new
          job log enty in job monitor.

        * Fixed incremental backups saving the same modified files
          for each invocation, thereby creating unnecessary index
          entries and wasting tape storage.

        * Fixed parsing of bad start times in backup and archive plans.

        * Fixed handling of backup index root directories containing
          special characters in pathname.

        * Improved progress reporting during volume change on restore

2006-03-01  Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 2.0.0 released. [The Three-Days-After Release]

2006-02-14  Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 2.0.0RC1 released.

2006-01-31  Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 2.0.0b5 released.

2006-01-18  Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 2.0.0b4 released.

2006-01-03  Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 2.0.0b3 released.

2005-11-07  Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 2.0.0b1 released.

2005-10-28  Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 1.5.14 released. Changes since last release

        * Fixed job executor blocking on very large number of parallel
          executing jobs.

        * Fixed searching in archive indexes when very first reported
          hit is located on non-existent volume. In such cases we got
          in endless loop effectively blocking the access to the
          database being queried.

        * Added protective locks arround Xinet desktop library which
          seems to be broken in MT-respect.

        * Added support for Sony PDD devices on Mac OSX and Linux.

        * Added adjustable session timeout settings for CLI sessions.
          The default is to expire the session after some inactivity
          time is passed. The inactivity time depends per default on
          the time of the day and varies between 2 hours and 1/2 hour.

          To override default setting, change to PresStore installation
          directory (default = /usr/local/aw), edit conf/lexxsrv.<port>
          file, where <port> is the TCP port for the PresStore server
          (default = 8000) and add these lines at the end of the file:

            ns_section ns/server/$server/module/clisrv
            ns_param sessionTimeout <number_of_seconds>

          <number_of_seconds> is the number of seconds for the timer.
          Possible values are:

            0 - default setup
           >0 - custom timer value
           -1 - timer is disabled (session never expires)

        * Fixed pre/post script execution on client which seemed to be
          broken since some earlier patch-release.

        * Loading media from mail-slot implicitly starts first barcode
          then mount inventory of the newly loaded slot (optionally).

        * Sync plans configured to check compatibility (default) between
          the source and the target directory refuse to operate if during
          the runtime the target directory is missing.

        * Fixed proper volume mounting of (already) burned DVD-/+R(W)
          media when restoring data from multiple mixed-media volumes
          (a combination of DVD-RAM's and DVD-/+R(W) media).

        * On Mac OSX, added 10 minute alarm signal in the watchdog
          proces to periodically test the server process existence
          and restart if the server died w/o properly signalling
          the watchdog. This behaviour was observed since 10.4 (Tiger)
          release and  resulted in server process not properly
          restarting when scheduled.

        * Fixed metadata handling in the file walker thread which
          caused occasional process hangs and/or cores.

        * Fixed configuration database recovery when the restored
          database schema did not match the schema used by the
          currently deployed software version.

        * Circumvented problems at media load for some revisions of
          IBM LTO3 tape-drives. Instead of immediately reacting on
          insane error codes delivered by the drive, we repeat the
          operation up to 4 times with 2 seconds delay in between
          and hope to get the drive finally load the media.

        * Mount inventory on optical jukeboxes with empty caddies
          failed prematurely. Instead of breaking the job at the
          first empty caddy, we count this case as valid, report
          the event and continue with the operation.

        * Added support for Linux Debian 3.0+ release.

        * Fixed sorting of archive selection when feeded with paths
          to files containing newline and/or carriage-return chars.

2005-08-18  Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 1.5.12 released. Changes since last release

        * Uses Xinet libraries for fileserver desktop maintenance

        * Fixed processing of FinderInfo streams for Xinet fileserver
          files lacking the resource fork files.

        * Fixed high-watermark of 95% when writing to optical media.

        * Fixed CLI handles of files with multinational and/or
          special characters in filenames.

        * Closed memory leak when archiving huge number of files.

        * Changed disk-device compression flag to be bound on device
          name instead of the device directory.

        * Non-interactive CLI sessions are now set to never expire.

        * Rewritten disk arbitration interface on Darwin. It now
          allows for restarting when the diskarbitrationd daemon
          crashes or hangs. Also, devices controlled by us never
          publish loaded media to other users of diskarbitrationd
          hence preventing them to interact with "our" disks.

        * Added force-killing of runaway processes in scd daemon.

        * Fixed deadlock situation happening when a job using the
          media management resources is terminating and user deletes
          the volume from the GUI.

        * Circumvented misleading error messages on media detach
          happening with some DVD-RAM drives in JVC 8000 jukeboxes.

        * Skip checking writability of per-client configured restore
          paths. We just run the restore and terminate the job with
          error if the restore path is unwritable by user.

        * Fixed importing of volumes containing continuation records.

2005-06-29  Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 1.5.11 released. Changes since last release

        * Fixed auto-starting issues on Mac OS X 1.4 OS-restart.

        * Recompiled Windows distribution to be more compatible
          with some older Windows versions.

        * Lowered high-watermark to 95% of the total available
          size of the media when writing to optical disks.

        * Added workarounds when mounting optical volumes on
          Mac OS X when the mount-point is already present as
          an orphan directory under the "/Volumes" root.

        * Under some rare circumstances, the job monitor did not
          show the request for mounting the continuation volume for
          multi-volume restore. This has been fixed.

        * Added directory mtime re-setting for Sync/Restore jobs.

        * Fixed burning of master images to optical discs for some
          firmware revisions and/or drive-types of DVD burners
          found in certain types of Plasmon changer units.

        * Fixed rare permission problems when uploading files as
          non-privileged user.

        * Upload file size is now limited to 256MB.

        * Added provisions to log incoming CLI commands and outgoing
          command results to aid debugging.

        * Transforms the host-id to lowercase in order to avoid
          generating licenses with bogus checksums when the supplied
          hostid does not case-match the auto-generated one.

        * Added graceful waits up to max of 1 minute between changing
          optical volumes during restore in order to overcome some
          strange and brief diskarbitrationd re-mounts on Darwin.

        * Suppresed debug warnings when re-mounting B-side of a
          double-sided DVD-RAM optical disc and the A-side is already
          correctly unmounted and ejected.

        * Fixed AppleSingle encoder/decoder to better handle certain error
          cases which caused infinite loops during stream decoding.

2005-05-25  Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 1.5.10 released. Changes since last release

        * Changed startup on Darwin 8.0 (aka Mac OSX 10.4, Tiger)
          to not to use symbolic links to PresSTORE startup script
          because of the tightened security issues.

        * Fixed reading of soft read/write errors from some
          tape-drives which do not correctly report SCSI log
          sense pages P0-P3.

        * Improved file deletion for archive clip generation
          using Helios layout utility. In some cases, if the
          clip generation failed, zero-length file corpses
          were left in the directory, effectively disabling the
          directory deletion on the job completion.

        * Recompiled some libraries with optimization in order
          to speed-up sequential searches on large archive indexes.

2005-05-16  Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 1.5.9 released. Changes since last release

        * Compiled for Mac OSX 10.4 (Tiger) release.

        * Fixed resource fork parsing when examining FPO images
          on Xinet volumes.

        * Provide option for disabling auto-load of Helios and
          Xinet filesystem drivers on server startup.

        * Single-drive is now allowed to write-mount any loaded
          volume as long it is found in the volume database, belongs
          to the required pool and is appendable.

2005-05-02  Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 1.5.8 released. Changes since last release

        * Added more CLI commands to examine/set Archive/Backup/Sync
          plan stati.

        * Added option to CLI to restore file(s) from archive database
          given the file physical path(s).

        * Fixed finder-info stream handling on Windows for files created
          by Xinet FullPress 11 & 14.

        * Fixed excessive reference count on jukebox resources
          which prevented the resource deletion after many
          recycle jobs have been completed.

        * Improved teardown of the per-device blockpool thread
          to prevent leaving the device node opened in some rare
          cases, thus avoiding "device busy" errors on subsequent
          operations on the same device.

        * Fixed volume recognition and reported sizes for Xsan
          volumes.

        * Avoid hitting the detached writer device during
          continuation on the next optical volume during archive.

        * Fixed file size summary displayed during file
          collection phase when walking over 2048GB+ volumes.

        * Corrected protection setting on Helios, Xinet resource
          directories during restore/sync which, under circumstances,
          did not match the protection of the parent directory.

        * Skip auto-enabling the Default-Archive login-area on startup
          since it may have been disabled by the customer.

        * Allow usage of decomposed unicode on Darwin in order to
          fully support UFS and Xsan volume types.

        * Increased retry count and timeout when loading volumes
          into slow responding drives. Instead of abandoning the
          operation after waiting for 20 seconds for a drive to
          load the volume, we now repeat the operation several
          times in a row and hope that the drive will catch-in.

        * Fixed syncing of plain Unix directories to Mac volumes
          (Helios, Xinet) and reverse.

        * Fixed rare deadlocks occuring when several media recycle
          operations were simultaenously underway in different drives.

        * Closed memory leak when a worker thread is being tear-down.

        * Added machine-type of i686 for the Linux distribution binaries.

        * License record entries are now forcefully blank-trimmed in order
          to workaround various bad-checksum problems introduced by people
          cut/pasting values and adding leading and/or trailing blanks.

        * Helios fileserver plugin now generates even more events for
          better integration in some workflow environments.

        Version 1.5.7 released. Changes since last release

        * Reduced count of retries when sending INQUIRY SCSI
          command to lazy and unresponsive tape drives (AIT-4).

        * Added workaround for multi-threading issues in
          conjuction with Solaris 2.9 and MP-machines.
          Due to some unknown reasons, deletion of files
          from the MT-process failed without any visible
          reason and failed to properly report the fact to
          the caller. This resulted in index failures during
          full backups.

        * Improved error message emited in transient situations
          when a backup plan tries to acquire a device which is
          currently handling the media-error event.

        * Added simple command-line tape-media checker which
          scans the tape-media and checks for soft and/or framing
          non-fatal read errors.

        * Improved deletion of files during full sync on Windows

        * Fixed restore on Windows when the relocation path did
          not exist and had be automatically created.

        * Added CLI provisions for making jukebox inventories both
          barcode and mount with optional slot ranges.

        * Added CLI provisions for manipulating status and stopping
          and starting of synchronize and backup plans.

2005-03-21  Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 1.5.6 released. Changes since last release

        * Improved jukebox configuration shows all available
          and not yet configured drives.

        * Fixed automount of single drives which did not work
          under all circumstances.

        * Added workaround for some broken LTO1 tape-drives
          from Seagate which failed to report correct block
          position after writing a filemark.

        * Set volume on "Suspect" when attempting to mount
          and seek to EOD and the operation fails.

        * Added automatic configuration of Solaris "sgen"
          driver when running on Solaris 2.8+. This driver
          is now used to communicate with jukebox devices.
          For older Solaris version, "awjb" driver is used.

        * Corrected problem with some jukeboxes which reported
          invalid (non-existent) slot addresses.

        * Helios fileserver plugin now generates more events
          for better integration in some workflow environments.

        * Corrected building of distribution files for client
          update. Some tar implementation (Darwin) were throwing
          error while tar-ing files are being changed (log-files).

2005-03-07  Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 1.5.5 released. Changes since last release

        * Fixed bug when sorting on dates in search window.

        * Emit warning log entries if we were unable to
          create previews using Helios Image server.

        * Initially sort search results on descending
          archive/backup date.

        * Fixed rare license-counting issues on remote
          clients when syncing several directoriees from
          the same server at the same time.

        * Work-around some broken revisions of Sony AIT-4
          tape drives which failed to return proper data
          on SCSI Inquiry. We are now persistent and repeat
          inquiry request several times before abandoning.

        * We will now forcefully restart the server if the
          graceful restart attempt failed.

        * Improved error message when attempting to recover
          configuration database from empty (labeled) tape.

        * Added support for japanese "shiftjis" encoding on
          Xinet volumes. This is a global server-wide setup.
          Please look at http://www.archiware.com/wiki/wiki/89
          to see how to enable alternate encodings for Xinet
          volumes.

        * Jukebox driver now reports stati of elements in
          exception instead od skipping them altogether.

        * Automatic jukebox configuration now ignores element
          exceptions (but logs them) while configuring drives.

        * Fixed broken notification message in server log
          after applying the cleaning cartridge on a drive
          which complains about need cleaning.

        * Resolved some issues with treating of paths
          containing multinational characters passed
          over the CLI interface.

        * Added new commands for alternative indexing of
          files archived over CLI interface.

        * Fixed mail delivery to root user from system
          generated jobs.

        * Fixed locking issues when multiple jobs get
          started and terminated by the job scheduler.

        * Fixed locking issues when multiple jobs attach
          to mounted tape pools during writing.

        * Disk-based tape emulator was generating incorrect
          links for emulated filemarks thus rendering such
          file-based volumes un-importable. This is now
          corrected.

        * Directories containing hidden (Finder-invisible)
          files were wrongly deleted after the archive if
          instructed so by the archive plan. Now we will
          skip deleting directories if they contain anything
          else then (hidden) fileserver-specific files.

        * Fixed volume label when labeling media cross-pools

        * Added wait/retry into load/rewind sequence for some
          weird HP Ultrium-2 drives which failed to rewind
          after media load

        * Forces default mediaType of TAPE for all unconfigured
          drives and jukebox devices.

2005-01-26 Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 1.5.4 released. Changes since last release

        * Fixed indexing of paths passed over the CLI and
          containing special escape characters

        * Fixed server logfile rolling on startup which
          caused server-start to fail under circumstances

2005-01-24 Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 1.5.3 released. Changes since last release

        * Fixed version checking for reverse server-client
          connections during client->server syncs

        * Fixed broken license check when installing
          lower-numbered licenses on higher-numbered distro

        * Improved recognition of SCSI target/lun for devices
          attached on some ATTO controllers and running
          under MacOS X 10.2.x

        * Fixed jukebox configuration when some of the
          devices in the jukebox could not be recognized
          and had to be skipped from the configuration

        * Fixed behaviour when loading media into some
          very slow drives which report insane ASC/ASCQ
          codes (some versions of the Matsushita DVD-RAM's
          delivered in Plasmon D-series jukeboxes)

        * Extended retries for slow-loading SDLT tapes

        * Fixed race condition happening on indexer thread
          when many parallel archive jobs compete for the
          same index database.

        * Fixed rare server segmentations caused by invalid
          references to standard output channel during zip
          file generations

        * Fixed proper index prefix for archive jobs running
          with master and copy pools set

        * Fixed empty directory deletion for archive jobs
          on Xinet and Mac OS X volumes

        * Fixed dead-loop of disk-based tape emulator when
          writing to a volume located on the root device
          and root device overflows

2005-01-05 Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 1.5.2 released. Changes since last release

        * Fixed problems with updating remote clients from
          Mac OS X servers.

        * Sun Solaris distribution contained older 1.5.0 release
          of some components causing sync plans from Sun clients
          to Mac/Linux servers to fail (i.e. transfer no data).

2004-12-30 Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 1.5.1 released. Changes since last release

        * Fixed stopping of sync plans with associated Helios event
          listeners.

        * Fixed wrong usage of clock drift between machines which
          caused sync to wrongly copy and discard files on target.

2004-12-20 Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 1.5.0 released. Changes since last release

        * Increased bucketpool size to 256 blocks for all writers

        * Fixed index problems introduced by changing directory
          structures while the backup job is running.

        * Added Windows binaries into the standard distribution
          to be able to update Windows clients from the server.

        * Server restart times are now configurable externally.
          Please look at http://www.archiware.com/wiki/wiki/82
          to see how to configure alternate server restart times.

        * Fixed indexer problem which may generate invalid
          internal caches for very deep directory structures.


2004-12-06 Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 1.5.0b7 released. Changes since last release

        * Added bandwidth throttle for client communication.
          It is now possible to limit the bandwidth usage
          consumed by PresStore while sending and/or receiving
          data to/from the networked client.

        * Added customized CLI extension capabilities and
          seeded with sources of useful utilities for batch
          processing of volumes and utilities for backup
          index check and repair. Look into the "modules/tcl/cli"
          directory for additional information about new commands.

        * Fixed cancellation issues during restore collection


2004-12-01 Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 1.5.0b6 released. Changes since last release

        * Fixed display of archive clips with special characters
          and/or umlauts in filename.

        * CLI server listens on all interfaces, including loopback


2004-11-27 Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 1.5.0b5 released. Changes since last release

        * Fixed CLI issues with national charsets on MacOS X

        * Improved handling (start/stop) of scd process

        * Improved error logging when unable to delete pool
          resources. We now try to be more informative and
          give approximate reason why the deletion failed.

        * Fixed wrong display of sizes in indexes for files
          larger than 2GB.

        * Improved script for distribution-file generation
          to exclude some unnecessary files. Also, we now
          conditionaly generate non-compressed tar files if
          the remote client lacks decompressing utilities.

        * Fixed connectivity problems to older pre-1.5 clients
          We incorrectly generated http authorization headers
          resulting in invalid username/password checking.


2004-11-05 Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 1.5.0b4 released. Changes since last release

        * Circumvented broken behaviour of Tandberg VS640
          autoloader unit which incorrectly returned junk data
          when examining picker element status.

        * Added automatic restart of the socket command daemon
          (scd) in case it blocks. This has been observed on
          Darwin platforms.  Also, start-server script now
          forcefully stops all lingering scd daemons before
          starting the application server.

        * Fixed blockpool thread termination and restart which
          caused the process to block when tearing down last
          opened storage device. This has been observed on
          Darwin in conjuction with chained backup plans and
          very slow clients.

        * Added additional level for SCSI logging so we can trace
          only errors and warnings without logging each separate
          SCSI command, thus avoiding logfile saturation.

        * Added additional logging when waiting for data to come
          from the remote client during backup/archive operations.

        * Fixed some rare side-effects within the file-finder
          thread when we were unable to stat() the directory due
          to some filesystem problems.

        * Improved handling of EOM events from tape devices which
          do not or incorrectly follow SCSI recommendations.

        * Keep backup of the configuration database instance so we
          can automatically switch to the last known state in case
          of database error.

        * Skip files during restore when max interleaving distance
          is exceeded.

        * Support resolving links to roots of Helios volumes

        * Fixed duplicate file/folder ID's for restores within
          Helios EtherShare volumes restored with "_R" option.

        * Do not filter folders/containers located on unknown
          volumes during browsing of backup and archive indexes.

        * Added DVD-RAM support for Darwin. On DVD-RAM we create
          either HFS+ or hybrid ISO/HFS/Joliet formats, depending
          on the mastering-mode setup of the media pool.

        * Revamped Darwin optical device handling and introduced
          internal interface to the disk arbitration framework.

        * Fixed differences for ATTO and Adaptec SCSI-device drivers
          and their IO registry signatures.

        * Disabled support for standalone optical devices. Until some
          later release, we will support only devices in jukeboxes.

        * Browser now opens all loginareas per default.

        * Added automatic index conversion when updating from older
          schema versions.

        * Added automatic license expiry for pre-1.5 licenses. There
          is a grace interval of 30 days allowing users to update to
          the latest license keys. After this time, all licenses are
          expired and must be entered again. This affects only
          permanent licenses. Demo licenses are not affected.


2004-10-17 Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 1.5.0b3 released. Changes since last release

        * Fixed handling of blank DVD+RW media. We now recognize
          blank discs and automatically format them in a quick mode

        * During installation on Linux, we now add startup scripts
          to the level 3 in addition to level 5 starup.

        * Fixed problem with optical device driver on Mac OS X
          which failed to open the device in shared mode.


2004-10-13 Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 1.5.0b2 released. Changes since last release

        * Added preliminary Sony PDD support (Linux only).

        * Fixed corruption of customerconfig databases happening
          during some OS crashes.

        * Significant improvement in diskdevice performance

        * Labeling diskdevice files is now much faster since it
          does not reserve place on the filesystem for each file.

        * Diskdevice naming scheme allows for controlling of the
          compression and debug flags. Example:

            /diskdevice/disk1   - no compression, no debugging
            /diskdevice/disk1c  - set compression, no debugging
            /diskdevice/disk1g  - set debugging, no compression
            /diskdevice/disk1cg - set compression and debugging

        * Optical disk volumes with valid cache-files can now be
          deleted if their state is set to "Suspect" manually.

        * Job-log entires are now marked red if the job has
          been cancelled or completed with any other code than OK.


2004-10-04 Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 1.5.0b1 released. Changes since last release

        * Various GUI improvements for backup index browsing

        * Expanded filters to include file modification date and size

        * Synchronize now checks remote modification times

        * Client job-logs are now properly reflected on the server

        * Improved backup index consistency checking and repair

        * Changes of Helios rsrc fork files does not automatically
          trigger processing of the data forks as well.

        * Added configuration options for various timeouts for
          client communication:

            writeTout - # of seconds for writing (default = 180)
            readTout  - # of seconds for reading (default = 7200)

          To override default setting, change to PresStore
          installation directory (default = /usr/local/aw),
          edit conf/lexxsrv.<port> file, where <port> is the
          TCP port for the PresStore server (default = 8000)
          and add these three lines at the end of the file:

            ns_section ns/server/$server/module/jobex/<client>
            ns_param writeTout <seconds>
            ns_param readTout  <seconds>

          <client> is the DNS name of the PresStore client
          <seconds> is the number of seconds for the timeout.

        * Added configuration options for rewriting user and group
          information for syncing across machines in different
          administrative domains:

            userMap  - alternate list of source and target user id's
            groupMap - alternate list of source and target group id's

          Using those options, PresStore sync will automatically rewrite
          user and group id's to match the above tables if the source
          user and/or group name could not be found on the target.

          To override default setting, change to PresStore
          installation directory (default = /usr/local/aw),
          edit conf/lexxsrv.<port> file, where <port> is the
          TCP port for the PresStore server (default = 8000)
          and add these three lines at the end of the file:

            ns_section ns/server/$server/module/jobex/<client>
            ns_param userMap <map_of_ids>
            ns_param groupMap <map_of_ids>

          <client> is the DNS name or the PresStore client
          <map_of_ids> is the list composed of source and target
          ids to me mapped, like for example:

            na_param userMap "100 1001 101 1002 103 1003"

          In this example, the user id 100 on the source will be
          mapped to the userid 1001 on the target, user id 101
          will be mapped to 1002 and so on.

        * Added shortcut to download of various PresStore files
          for debugging purposes

        Version 1.5.0a3 released. Changes since last release

        * Fixed handling of some Unicode sequences which caused
          sync plans to wrongly delete and sync files/directories
          having those sequences in their path names.

        * Added server-wide configuration for default mailserver
          and mailsender for the PresStore mail utility.

          To override default setting, change to PresStore
          installation directory (default = /usr/local/aw),
          edit conf/lexxsrv.<port> file, where <port> is the
          TCP port for the PresStore server (default = 8000)
          and add these three lines at the end of the file:

            ns_section ns/server/$server/module/utility/mail
            ns_param mailServer <hostname_or_ip_address>
            ns_param mailSender <sender_email_adderss>

          <hostname_or_ip_address> is the DNS name or the TCP
          address of the mail server (or mail transfer agent).
          Default is: localhost

          <sender_email_address> is the email address of the sender.
          Default is: root@localhost

        * Fixed intermittent problems with FibreChannel devices
          on Mac OS X reporting spurious POWER-ON conditions.

        * Added user-id/group-id mapping tables for backup/restore

        * Improved device-scan for Linux

        * Extended CLI to allow partial creation/modification of resources


2004-07-21 Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 1.4.5 released. Changes since last release

        * Relaxed locking on SCSI devices on Darwin. Instead of globally
          locking the SCSI transport layer, we now selectively lock on
          the device instance, thus improving the overall throughput.

        * Relaxed limit of 50 hits per search session. Now we allow up
          to 1000 hits per search.

        * Added selection of media pools for searches in backup/archive
          indexes.

        * Fixed broken "Cancel" button during client backup index checks.


2004-07-14 Zoran Vasiljevic <zv@archiware.com>

        Version 1.4.4 released. Changes since last release

        * Fixed race conditions for SCSI devices on Darwin which caused
          backup and/or archive jobs scheduled to run on the same pool
          and device to break.

        * Improved checking of the customer database on server start.
          We now try to repair eventually broken database, instead of
          trashing it immediately and creating the new one.

        * Improved handling for Helios desktop. In some rare cases we
          were unable to set the ID of the item after sync/restore so
          we left the old item ID in place. This resulted in duplicate
          item IDs. Now, we clear the item ID (set to zero) if unable
          to assign new one. Also, we never reuse ID's when syncing or
          restoring files. We do always generate new ID's since this
          proved much more stable, given the actual support for reusing
          file/folder ID's in Helios desktop library.

        * Fixed backup plan scheduling problem. Monthly schedule didn't
          execute if for the corresponding day in the weekly schedule
          "skip" was chosen.

        * Work-around for indexing library which, in rare circumstances,
          generated bad or not-mountable index files.

        * Fixed strange OS-issues on Sun resulting in periodical hanging
          of sync-plans.

        * Fixed handling of some Unicode sequences which caused sync
          plans to wrongly delete and re-sync files/directories having
          those sequences in their path names.

        * Fixed intermittent problems with FibreChannel devices on
          Mac OS X reporting spurious POWER-ON conditions.

        * Added server-wide configuration for default mailserver and
          mailsender for the PresStore mail utility.

          To override default setting, change to PresStore installation
          directory (default=/usr/local/aw), edit conf/lexxsrv.<port>
          file, where <port> is the TCP port for the PresStore server
          (default=8000) and add these lines at the end of the file:

            ns_section  ns/server/$server/module/utility/mail
            ns_param mailServer  <hostname_or_ip_address>
            ns_param mailSender  <sender_email_adderss>

          where:

          <hostname_or_ip_address> is the DNS name or the TCP address
          of the mail server (or mail transfer agent).
          Default is: localhost

          <sender_email_address> is the email address of the sender.
          Default is: root@localhost

        * Added server-wide configuration for cross-checking volumes
          within backup indexes on server startup.

          To override default setting, change to PresStore installation
          directory (default=/usr/local/aw), edit conf/lexxsrv.<port>
          file, where <port> is the TCP port for the PresStore server
          (default=8000) and add these lines at the end of the file:

            ns_section ns/server/$server/module/bixselector
            ns_param crossCheckVolumes true

          Default setting of the parameter is "false" which means that
          volumes are not cross-checked at the system start.
